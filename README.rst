Raspberry Pi X10 Home Automation
********************************

X10_ home automation based on a `Raspberry Pi_, heyu_, a `CM11A module`_
and some `Python 3`_ code.

Use ``cron``, the schedule feature of heyu_, and rule sets defined in Python
data structures to upload a daily schedule to the X10_ controller.
Lets the `Raspberry Pi`_ control routine lighting and appliance state changes
or lets you give your home a lived-in appearance when you are away.
