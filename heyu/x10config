# Combine events having the same date range, time, etc.,
# by concatenating the macros for similar events

# Don't allow heyu to compress uploaded macros by combining unit codes
# for the same housecode and command and eliminating duplicates

# Longitude and latitude for dawn/dusk calculations.
LONGITUDE  W123:07  # [degrees:minutes East or West of Greenwich]
LATITUDE   N49:16   # [degrees:minutes North or South of equator]
# For dawn/dusk related times, Heyu breaks up the schedule date intervals
# into subintervals, each with a constant value of dawn or dusk time.
# These directives instruct Heyu what value of dawn/dusk time to use.
# The default value is FIRST, i.e., that on the first day of the subinterval,
# which is most convenient for comparing Heyu's computations with actual.
DAWN_OPTION  FIRST

# Write some additional files when the command 'heyu upload check'
# is executed.
